This augmented reality tutorial is a first look at the Apple ARkit. We will use Unity 3D and the Apple AR kit unity package to create a zombie AR app.  
The SLAM tracking that Apple offers is incredible and I could not help but do this video. I hate doing things that are not cross platform compatible but this Apple AR is way too good to ignore.  
To follow along you will need Xcode 9 beta, IOS 11, and the newest patch version of Unity 5.6.1p1.

{{< youtube hfxfx-XXLEo >}}

The fourth demo of my ARKit dataviz tool/api, adding some image recognition for displaying nutritional value of food.  

The app contains a small database of common fruits and their nutritional value. After recognizing something it generates the visual based on the database, you can see the frame drops both when it is recognizing the banana and when it is generating the visual.

Welcome to the weekly FusedVR Tutorials! These videos/streams are a chance not only for anyone to learn more about AR/VR development, but also a chance for anyone to ask questions about LITERALLY anything! Whether it be about your own AR/VR development, your future projects, or just AR/VR in general, we would love to talk with you about it!  

Suggestions for future streams. Post Here: [http://fusedvr.com](http://fusedvr.com)  

If you missed last week's stream, here is a link to the video where we go over how to build the VATS mechanic from Fallout!

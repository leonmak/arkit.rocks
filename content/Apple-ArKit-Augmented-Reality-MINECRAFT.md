Apple ARkit Tutorial Coming Soon! This is a little demo video of an augmented reality AR Minecraft app that I have been working on using the Apple ARkit for iPhone and Unity 3D. I love that you are able to place life size objects because the tracking with ARkit is so good. Let me know in the comments if you want to see a how to video or tutorial and I will try to make that happen. I probably won't be able to do the whole thing, but let me know what parts of this you would like to do.  

GitHub Project can be found in our discord group: [https://discord.gg/JTXEXts](https://discord.gg/JTXEXts)  

The SLAM tracking that Apple offers is incredible and I cannot stop playing with it. I hate doing things that are not cross platform compatible but this Apple AR is way too good to ignore.  

To build this I used Xcode 9 beta, IOS 11, and the newest patch version of Unity 5.6.1p1.  

You also need an apple device with an A9 or A10 chip.  

These include:  

-iPhone SE  

-iPhone 6s  

-iPhone 6s Plus  

-iPhone 7  

-iPhone 7 Plus  

-iPad Pro  

- 9.7-inch iPad 2017
